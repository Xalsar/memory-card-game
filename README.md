Memory card game made with React, Redux, Express and MongoDB.

Register, play and see the global scores.


## Install and run the app
`gh repo clone Xalsar/memory-card-game`

In the project root file: `yarn install && cd client && yarn install && yarn build && cd ../`

Create a `config/dev.env` with `PORT` (host where the app will run) and `MONGODB_URL` (where the db can be found) constants.

And lastly `yarn dev` to run the app in development and `yarn start` to run in it in production mode.
